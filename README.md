# Alexa GPT Multilingual Assistant

## Description

Alexa GPT Multilingual Assistant is an Alexa skill that leverages OpenAI's GPT-4 to provide conversational AI capabilities in multiple languages. The skill allows users to ask questions or request information, and it responds appropriately in the user's language. This project demonstrates how to build a multilingual Alexa skill using a single interaction model and dynamically handling language-specific responses.
